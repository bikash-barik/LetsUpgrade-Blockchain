Working With Errors in Solidity
Errors can occur due to syntax issues, logical issues, transactional reasons or the user can prompt for error if required.
Like any other programming Language you can handle errors with try/catch block even in solidity.
•	Throw
•	Require
•	Assert
•	Revert
Throw
•	The user can use “Throw” keyword to cause an error if required.
•	It does not return any Ether spent but rollbacks changes to the data alone
Disadvantages
•	All gas is consumed, everything reverted
•	Impossible to tell users why the call failed
•	Errors cannot be caught, so they cannot be handled gracefully
Require
•	Used to check pre-requisite conditions and throw an exception if the condition is not satisfied
•	Used to ensure valid conditions that cannot be detected until execution time
•	This includes conditions on inputs or return values from calls to external contracts.
•	When a require condition fails, solidity internally performs a “revert” operation
•	Uses the 0xfd opcode to cause an error condition
 
 
Syntax : require(condition, error message)
 
Assert
•	It is similar to “require” operation
•	Used to check pre-requisite conditions and throw an exception if the condition is not satisfied
•	User should apply assert only for internal errors or for analyzing invariants.
•	Properly functioning code should never reach a failing assert statement
•	It does not return any gas consumed
Syntax : assert(condition, error message)
 
Revert
•	Another way to trigger exceptions from within other code blocks to flag an error and revert the current call.
•	It takes an optional string message containing details about the error that is passed back to the caller
 
Syntax : 
condition
revert(error message)
